# 📄 ChatPDF+

ChatPDF+ is a local, privacy-preserving PDF Question Answering system that allows users to upload one or more PDF documents and ask questions about their content. The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to ensure that answers are generated strictly from the uploaded documents, reducing hallucinations commonly seen in general-purpose language models.
